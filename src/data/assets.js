/**
 * Swappable art for the painted island.
 *
 * The ground is one picture (the concept plate). Tall objects are separate
 * images cut from that same picture so Pibo can walk behind them. Replace a
 * PNG, or point `src` at a new one, and refresh. Width and height are world
 * units on the plate (the painting is 32 units wide). Anchor y 0 is the
 * bottom edge, which sits on the feet line used for depth sorting.
 *
 * Pibo's frames live under `states`. See ASSETS.md.
